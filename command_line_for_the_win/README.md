## Background

This project revolves around CMD CHALLENGE, a voluntary endeavor designed to help you enhance your command line abilities. It's essential to follow the guidelines and instructions provided below.

## Requirements

Before diving into the tasks, let's go over the general requirements for this project:

1. You must create a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder. This file will provide necessary information about the project.
2. The project will be manually reviewed, so make sure to meet the expectations and complete the tasks accordingly.
3. As you progress through the tasks, the completed task names will turn green to indicate your progress.
4. You are required to take screenshots as evidence of completing the tasks. Save these screenshots in either PNG or JPEG format.
5. Push the screenshots to GitHub in the following directory: `/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/`.

## Tasks

The CMD CHALLENGE consists of several tasks, each building on the previous one. The tasks are organized into three groups:

### First 九 tasks

In this section, you need to complete the first nine tasks and submit the screenshots to GitHub. The required files are:

- `0-first_9_tasks.jpg`
- `0-first_9_tasks.png`

### Reach חי completed tasks

Continue the challenge by completing the next nine tasks, reaching a total of 18 completed tasks. Save the screenshots as:

- `1-next_9_tasks.jpg`
- `1-next_9_tasks.png`

### Reach the perfect cube, 27

The final phase involves completing the last nine tasks, achieving a total of 27 completed tasks. Save the screenshots as:

- `2-next_9_tasks.jpg`
- `2-next_9_tasks.png`

## SFTP File Transfer

In addition to completing the CMD CHALLENGE tasks and uploading the screenshots to GitHub, you are required to demonstrate the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool. Follow these steps to transfer the local screenshots to the sandbox environment:

1. Capture the screenshots of the completed levels as per the general requirements.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
3. Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided for the sandbox environment.
4. Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
5. Use the SFTP `put` command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
6. Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
7. After transferring the screenshots, proceed to push them to GitHub, adhering to the initial requirements.

Ensure you include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your project's `README.md` file. This will help reviewers understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.

Please note that the screenshots of completed levels should be inside the directory `/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/`.
